                            Inequality is a main cause of Poverty. Inequality fuels poverty
                            by limiting opportunities for people based on factors like gender
                            or ethnicity. For example, women often have fewer rights, making
                            it harder for them to improve their situation. When combined with 
                            other risks, like being a widow or a refugee, these inequalities
                            worsen, creating a cycle of poverty that's hard to escape.

                            Conflict is one of the biggest factors that can push people into
                            poverty. War and crises can completely disrupt economies.
                            For example, before the Syrian conflict started in 2011,
                            only 10% of Syrians lived below the poverty line, but by 
                            the end of 2023, over 90% were living in poverty. While many
                            conflicts today are more localized and get less international
                            attention, large-scale crises like the one in Ukraine show how
                            a major conflict can affect economies around the world.

                            Poverty and hunger create a cycle: not having enough food weakens peopleâ€™s health,
                            making it harder to work and increasing medical debt. This cycle is especially damaging
                            for children, as malnourished mothers often have malnourished kids.
                            The effects can last a lifetime, with stunted children earning less
                            as adults and contributing to economic losses in countries like Ethiopia.

                            Extreme poverty and poor health are closely connected,

                            For women, pregnancy can be life-threatening, especially in patriarchal
                            societies where they need male permission for care. Teenage mothers,
                            particularly unmarried ones, face even more discrimination and inequality.
