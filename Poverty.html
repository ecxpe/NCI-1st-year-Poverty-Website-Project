				<h2>The current crisis in Chad</h2>
				<p>Poverty has profoundly impacted Chad, one of the poorest countries in the world, with far-reaching consequences for its people 
				and development. Over two-thirds of the population lives below the poverty line, relying on subsistence agriculture and
				pastoralism in a country plagued by recurring droughts and limited arable land. This economic hardship has stifled access
				to basic necessities like education, healthcare, and clean water, leaving millions vulnerable to malnutrition and preventable
				diseases. The lack of infrastructure and job opportunities perpetuates cycles of poverty, while political instability and
				conflict further exacerbate the situation. Despite being rich in natural resources, such as oil, the wealth has not translated
				into significant poverty alleviation for the majority, highlighting deep inequalities. International aid and sustainable
				development initiatives remain crucial in addressing these challenges and fostering long-term stability in Chad.</p>
