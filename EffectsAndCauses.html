                            Stress is an important factor regarding the effects of Poverty.
                            As stress levels increase, it becomes more difficult for individuals to focus on their work.
                            This lack of concentration can negatively impact their performance, leading to mistakes or
                            unfinished tasks. As a result, the worry about potentially losing their job begins to grow,
                            creating a cycle of anxiety that only adds to the stress.

                            Financial freedom is also a main factor regarding the effects
                            of Poverty. Financial struggles can lead to social isolation
                            , as people may not have the money to participate in events 
                            or activities, like going out with friends or visiting family.
                            Others might think they're avoiding socializing, even though 
                            it's actually a time when they need support the most.

                            Growing up in poverty can affect someone's upbringing.
                            Poverty has a significant impact on children's health, development,
                            and well-being. Children growing up in poverty are more likely to
                            experience a variety of health problems, including poor nutrition,
                            chronic diseases, and mental health issues. These challenges can affect
                            their social, emotional, and cognitive development, leading to difficulties
                            in behavior and school performance. As a result, children in poverty may
                            struggle to reach their full potential, facing obstacles that can affect them
                            throughout their lives.

                            Sacrifices have to be made in hopes for the greater future.
                            Parents in difficult situations often make extreme sacrifices,
                            going without food and basic necessities to ensure that their
                            children and dependents have everything they need. They prioritize
                            their family's well-being over their own, enduring hardship and discomfort
                            so that their loved ones don't have to. This deep sense of responsibility 
                            and selflessness can take a toll on parents, but they continue to put others
                            first, even when it means struggling themselves.
